_students.py_
1.  In /login/{username} description change username for email. In your code it mentions that login is with email, so same comment should apply here.
2.  You could add {student_id} in /mark_course_completed since a student_id is used as a parameter. Also adds clarity that marking course complete for that student. 
3. You can also do the above  in /plan_course
4. In get_student you can change router to only return vital student info. name, last, email, major
> @router.get("/students/{student_id}", response_model = Student)
5. If get_student is separated, you can return a list of planned and completed courses. 
>  @router/"students/{student_id}, response_model = List[CompletedCourses] ) 
6. Change post to patch ion mark-course_completed since a previous course  can be updated

_majors.py_
7.   In get_majors as a response model return  List[Major]. Rerturns a cleaner list

_courses.py_
8.  @router.get("/", response_model =List(Course).  Ensures all return values are a valid course
9.  Returning a course in most functions. Add the response-model depending on function for clarity and proper check. 

_planner.py_
10. Change get to post in /planner/create-course_plan. You're creating a planner not getting an active one, according to description given.
11.  in get_requirement add {student_id} to match parameter in function. Also helps clarify that it's requirements for that student.
12. Remove hi. Not useful
