Our application checks the course database at a college (in this case we will likely input the courses applicable to two majors offered at Cal Poly), and a table containing courses that the user has already completed (entered by the user). It then builds a map of the courses based on their degree path, concentration, completed courses, and prerequisites as a graph. We then implement a shortest path graph traversal algorithm based on the student’s desired degree path/concentration/career path to find the path with the minimum number of courses necessary to achieve that goal. The application will return a “road map” of the optimal path of courses for the student to take based on their interests and completed courses.
