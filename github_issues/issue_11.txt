1. You have bottler.py, carts.py etc., that is not being used, so I would suggest  removing those files for clarity
2. In courses.py, all routes return raw dictionaries, even though the Course model is defined. Adding response_model=Course or List[Course] would help structure the data
3. The /code/{department_code}/{course_number} endpoint currently returns "Course not found" even if the department itself doesn't exist. Consider explicitly checking whether the department exists first and returning a more helpful error like "Department not found" vs "Course not found in this department"
4. Even though the Major model is defined, it isn’t used as a response_model. Adding it to /majors and /majors/{id} would improve and validate responses
5. In create_student(), you’re accepting email: str, but since you import EmailStr from Pydantic, you can use email: EmailStr to get free validation that the email is correctly formatted.
6. In create_student(), you specify response_model=Student, but you return a manually built dict instead of a response with Student. Returning a real Pydantic object would ensure it matches the schema exactly and reduce errors.
7. You're repeating the same SQL checks in multiple endpoints (mark_course_completed, plan_course, etc.) to see if a student or course exists. Maybe you can make a helper function like validate_student() or validate_course() to avoid repetition. 
8.  Take lowercase into account, csc should also work to get major specific details, instead of just CSC
9. If a major doesn’t have any required courses defined, the planner returns an empty plan. It might be helpful to return a warning or message saying "No major requirements found."
10. The grade and quarter_taken fields on the CompletedCourse model can be literally anything. You could restrict grades to "A", "B+", etc. and add validation for quarters e.g., "Fall 2024".
11. The mark_course_completed and plan_course endpoints just return a blank 204. Returning { "message": "Course marked as completed" } would be more helpful, especially when testing.
12. For logging in, it would be helpful to be specific about whether it is the username that’s wrong or the password, instead of returning "Incorrect username or password”.
